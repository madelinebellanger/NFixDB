Scripts - found in bin
alignments.sh - MAFFT alignments and HMM builds for all files
analysis.py - runs analysis on tophits.tsv, finds which genomes have all three of each group of genes, outputs filteredhits.tsv
analysis_fasta.py - same as analysis.py, but runs on topfasta.tsv, outputs filteredfasta.tsv
cd-hit.sh - runs CD-HIT on fasta files to find clusters at 97%, 99%, and 100% similarity
final.py - makes/formats final TSV, outputs NFixDB.tsv
hmmsearch.sh - combine HMMs and run hmmsearch
nitrogenase_fastas.py - creates new fasta files from filteredfasta.tsv
outsideDBs_class.sh - runs outside_dbs_class.py and outside_dbs_hits.py
outside_dbs.sh - HMM searches of all outside databases analyzed
outside_dbs_class.py - same as taxonomy.py, but with outside databases results. Outputs RAW_OutsideDBs_class.tsv
outside_dbs_hits.py - similar to tophits.py, find the top result of each sequence ID and outputs RAW_OutsideDBs_hits.tsv
sql.py - creates SQL database of all TSVs
ssu.sh - runs barrnap on genomes in filteredhits_i3.tsv
SSU_int.py - integrates SSU results into filteredhits_i3.tsv. Outputs filt_wSSU_i3.tsv
tax_hits.sh - runs taxonomy.py, tophits.py, topfastas.py, analysis.py, and nitrogenase_fastas.py
taxonomy.py - finds sequences that are within ≤ e-10 cutoff and gets taxonomy of genomes. Outputs evalue_taxonomy.tsv for those within cutoff range
topfastas.py - same as tophits.py, but includes a cutoff of ≤ e-15 or bitscore of ≥50. Outputs topfasta.tsv
tophits.py - finds top results of each gene and sequence ID within the genomes (i.e. take the nifD result with e-104 rather than those with e-92 or e-63). Outputs tophits.tsv
