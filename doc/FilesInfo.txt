Scripts
alignments.sh - mafft alignments and hmm builds for all files
fastas.sh - runs topfastas.py, analysis.py, and nitrogenase_fastas.py
hmmsearch.sh - combine HMMs and run hmmsearch
NFixDB.sh - entire process, start to finish. Did not use as actual script since it would’ve taken far too long
tax_hits.sh - runs taxonomy.py, tophits.py, topfastas.py, analysis.py, and nitrogenase_fastas.py
analysis.py - runs analysis on tophits.tsv or topfasta.tsv, finds which genomes have all three of each group of genes, outputs filteredhits.tsv or mergefasta.tsv, depending on input file
nitrogenase_fastas.py - creates new fasta files from mergefasta.tsv
taxonomy.py - finds sequences that are within ≤ e-10 cutoff and gets taxonomy of genomes. Outputs evalue_taxonomy.tsv for those within cutoff range and oor_taxonomy.tsv for those out of the cutoff range
topfastas.py - same as tophits.py, but includes a cutoff of ≤ e-15 or bitscore of ≥50. Outputs topfasta.tsv
tophits.py - finds top results of each gene within the genomes (i.e. take the nifD result with e-104 rather than those with e-92 or e-63). Outputs tophits.tsv

TSVs
complete_taxonomy.tsv - GTDB and NCBI taxonomy obtained from GTDB metadata file
evalue_taxonomy(_i2 or _i3).tsv - all sequences that meet ≤ e-10 cutoff (very large file)
filteredhits(_i2 or _i3).tsv - genomes that have all three genes within a group (i.e. nifHDK) from tophits.tsv
mergefasta(_i2 or _i3).tsv - genomes that have all three genes within a group (i.e. nifHDK) from topfasta.tsv
oor_taxonomy(_i2 or _i3).tsv - all sequences that DO NOT meet ≤ e-10 cutoff (very large file)
topfasta_i2 or _i3).tsv - top results of each gene from evalue_taxonomy.tsv that are within cutoff of ≤ e-15 or bitscore of ≥ 50 
tophits(_i2 or _i3).tsv - top results of each gene from evalue_taxonomy.tsv
hitsWTax_i3.tsv - same as filteredhits_i3.tsv, but with taxonomy included
