Scripts - found in bin
aligns_hmms.sh - MAFFT alignments and HMM builds for all files (i2-2-3)
analysis.py - runs analysis on tophits.tsv, finds which genomes have all three of each group of genes, outputs filteredhits.tsv
analysis_fasta.py - same as analysis.py, but runs on topfasta.tsv, outputs filteredfasta.tsv
cd-hit.sh - runs CD-HIT on fasta files to find clusters at 97%, 99%, and 100% similarity
final.py - makes/formats final TSV, outputs NFixDB.tsv
hmmsearch.sh - combine HMMs and run hmmsearch
nitrogenase_fastas.py - creates new fasta files from filteredfasta.tsv
oDB_class.py - same as taxonomy.py, but with an addiional cutoff of alignment length > 150 for the outside database results. Outputs oDB_class.tsv
oDB_cluster.sh - clusters outside databases at 97%, 99%, and 100% similarity
oDB_hits.py - similar to tophits.py, find the top result of each sequence ID and outputs oDB_hits.tsv
oDB_hmm.sh - runs hmmsearch on outside databases using the HMMs produced from i2-2-3
sql.py - creates SQL database of all TSVs
ssu.sh - runs barrnap on genomes in filteredhits_i2-2-3.tsv
ssu.py - integrates SSU results into filteredhits_i2-2-3.tsv. Outputs filteredhits_SSU_i2-2-3.tsv
taxonomy.py - finds sequences that are within ≤ e-10 cutoff and gets taxonomy of genomes. Outputs evalue_taxonomy.tsv for those within cutoff range and oor_taxonomy.tsv for those out of the cutoff range
topfastas.py - same as tophits.py, but includes a cutoff of ≤ e-15, bitscore of ≥50, or alignment length of >125. Outputs topfasta.tsv
tophits.py - finds top results of each gene and sequence ID within the genomes (i.e. take the nifD result with e-104 rather than those with e-92 or e-63). Outputs tophits.tsv
